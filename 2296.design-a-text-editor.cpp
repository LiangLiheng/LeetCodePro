Step 1: Read the problem statement. What specific inputs does THIS problem give you? What exact outputs must you produce? State these concretely for THIS task.

Step 2: ANTI-META-ANALYSIS CHECKPOINT - Are you analyzing THIS specific problem or describing general approaches? You must work with the actual problem details, not abstract frameworks. If describing general approaches, STOP and refocus immediately.

Step 3: Analyze THIS problem's operations and constraints. What data structure choices do these specific requirements suggest?

Step 4: Select and justify your approach for THIS specific problem. Which data structures and algorithms will you use and why?

Step 5: For each required operation in THIS problem, plan the exact implementation logic and edge cases.

Step 6: Write the complete code for THIS problem in the specified language. Fill in all method bodies with working logic.

Step 7: Test your code mentally against the provided example and edge cases from THIS problem.

Step 8: Verify your output: "reasoning" contains your analysis of solving THIS problem (not generic advice), "result" contains complete, copy-pasteable code in the required language (not descriptions or placeholders).

Step 9: EXECUTION TEST - Read your "result" field. Can it be directly executed in the specified language? If it contains anything other than compilable code, you have failed to solve the problem.
