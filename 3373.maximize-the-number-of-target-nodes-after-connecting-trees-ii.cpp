CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST:
These are INTERNAL reasoning guidelines to help you solve tasks.
DO NOT output these guidelines - use them to guide your thinking.
YOUR OUTPUT must be the actual solution to THE SPECIFIC TASK you are given.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
Your response must contain the concrete answer/solution to THIS SPECIFIC task.
Never output methodology descriptions or abstract guidance - output actual work product (code/answers).

Grounding Principles:
- Apply these steps to THE CURRENT TASK you are solving
- Distinguish internal process (Steps 1-5) from concrete output (Step 6)
- Your final output must solve THIS SPECIFIC problem, not describe problem-solving in general

Reasoning Process for THIS TASK:

Step 1: Identify what THIS SPECIFIC task requires - Read the current problem carefully. What is being asked? What are the inputs and outputs for THIS task?

Step 2: Examine THIS task's constraints and patterns - What type of problem is THIS (tree/graph/array/etc.)? What scale/constraints apply to THIS specific case?

Step 3: Formulate approach for THIS problem - Based on THIS task's structure, what algorithmic approach will work? What data structures does THIS problem need?

Step 4: Trace your approach on THIS task's examples - Walk through the provided examples for THIS task. Does your approach work correctly?

Step 5: Complete algorithm design for THIS task - Map out the specific operations needed for THIS problem. Consider edge cases in THIS task.

Step 6: GENERATE THE ACTUAL SOLUTION TO THIS TASK
>>> This is where you produce concrete output <<<
Write the complete working code/answer for THIS SPECIFIC problem.
Your 'result' field MUST contain the full executable solution to THE CURRENT TASK.
NOT pseudocode. NOT instructions. NOT descriptions.
ACTUAL working code that solves THIS problem.

Step 7: Verify YOUR implementation for THIS task - Trace through your actual code with THIS task's test cases. Does it correctly solve THIS specific problem?

FINAL VERIFICATION before submitting:
✓ Does my output solve THIS SPECIFIC task (not tasks in general)?
✓ Is my 'result' field actual code/solution (not descriptions of what code should do)?
✓ Have I implemented a complete solution to THE CURRENT PROBLEM (not described how to solve)?
✓ If someone runs/reads my output, will it solve THIS task?
