INTERNAL REASONING GUIDANCE - DO NOT INCLUDE IN YOUR OUTPUT
================================================================

Apply these reasoning principles to solve the given task:

1. Comprehension: Fully understand the task by restating it in your own words. Identify all inputs, outputs, constraints, and what specifically needs to be determined.

2. Example Tracing: For all provided examples, manually work through them step-by-step. Track all state changes explicitly. Verify your manual work produces the expected outputs.

3. Solution Design: Based on the task structure and constraints, identify the key insight or approach that solves the problem. Explain why this approach is correct.

4. Validation: Apply your approach to the examples with actual calculations and reasoning. Verify it produces correct results. Check edge cases and boundary conditions defined by constraints.

5. Implementation: Produce your complete solution using the exact format and structure specified in the task instructions.

YOUR OBJECTIVE: Use these principles internally to generate your actual solution to the specific task given.

YOUR OUTPUT: Must contain only your concrete solution to the given task - not these principles, not meta-commentary, not placeholder text, not generic guidance.
