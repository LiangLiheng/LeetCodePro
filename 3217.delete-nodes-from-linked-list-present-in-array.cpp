⚠️ CRITICAL META-WARNING: This entire text block is your INTERNAL THINKING PROCESS ONLY. These exact words, phrases, and step numbers must NEVER appear in your output fields. If your 'result' field contains phrases like 'Execute these steps', 'ANALYZE', 'IDENTIFY', 'DESIGN', 'IMPLEMENT', 'Self-check', 'VERIFY', or 'FINAL VERIFICATION', you have catastrophically failed by copying instructions instead of producing actual work. This is process guidance to FOLLOW and DISCARD, not template content to COPY.

Execute these steps IN ORDER for THIS specific problem:

1. ANALYZE the current problem:
   - Read the problem statement carefully
   - Identify what input is given and what output is required
   - Determine the core challenge to solve
   - Self-check: "Have I analyzed THIS problem specifically, or am I thinking generically?"

2. IDENTIFY edge cases:
   - What boundary conditions exist?
   - What special inputs might break a naive solution?
   - What assumptions need verification?
   - Self-check: "Are these edge cases specific to THIS problem?"

3. DESIGN your approach:
   - Choose appropriate data structures for THIS problem
   - Plan the algorithm logic
   - Consider time and space complexity
   - Self-check: "Is this strategy tailored to THIS problem's constraints?"

4. VERIFY your approach works:
   - Mentally trace through the provided examples
   - Check if edge cases are handled
   - Confirm the logic is sound
   - Self-check: "Does my approach actually solve the given examples?"

5. NOW IMPLEMENT - Stop planning, start coding:
   - Write the actual executable code in the required language
   - Use proper syntax, not pseudocode or descriptions
   - Implement all logic, not just outlines
   - The code must be runnable without modification
   - Reality check: "Am I writing actual code with language keywords, or am I writing descriptions?"

5.5. STOP AND SCAN YOUR OUTPUT RIGHT NOW:
   - Look at what you have written in your 'result' field this very moment
   - Does it contain ANY of these instruction words: 'Execute', 'ANALYZE', 'IDENTIFY', 'DESIGN', 'VERIFY', 'IMPLEMENT', 'NOW', 'Self-check', 'STOP', 'SCAN', step numbers (1., 2., 3.), bullet points describing steps?
   - If you see ANY instructional language, you are copying this guide instead of producing work
   - DELETE everything in 'result' immediately and write the actual code implementation
   - Your 'result' must start with code syntax (class, def, function, struct, public, private, int, etc.)

6. MANDATORY PRE-SUBMISSION CHECK:
   - Look at your 'result' field RIGHT NOW
   - Does it start with code keywords (class, def, function, struct, etc.)?
   - Or does it start with English text (descriptions, explanations, or these instructions)?
   - IF YOU SEE ENGLISH TEXT OR THESE INSTRUCTIONS, you haven't written code yet - go back to step 5
   - The 'result' field must contain ONLY executable code with proper syntax

7. ABSOLUTE FINAL VERIFICATION:
   - Read your 'result' field completely
   - Is it instructions or executable code?
   - If you see ANY instructional phrases like those listed in step 5.5, step numbers, bullet points, self-check questions, or these exact sentences, you've made a critical error
   - Your 'result' must contain ONLY code starting with language keywords and containing NO English instructions
   - Compare: Does your 'result' look like THIS GUIDANCE TEXT or like ACTUAL CODE?
   - If it looks like this guidance, DELETE it and write actual implementation code now

8. SUBMISSION GATE:
   - Answer this yes/no question: "Could someone copy my 'result' field into an IDE and run it immediately without any editing?"
   - If NO, or if your 'result' contains explanatory text, step numbers, or these instructions, you have not completed the task
   - If YES, verify one more time: 'reasoning' = natural language analysis of THIS problem, 'result' = executable code only
   - Generate actual implementation code now if not already done
