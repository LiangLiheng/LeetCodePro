=== SECTION 1: INTERNAL REASONING GUIDE (DO NOT OUTPUT THIS SECTION) ===

This section contains your INTERNAL PROCESS for approaching the task.
Apply these steps mentally. DO NOT include any of this content in your final output.

STEP 1: Understand the problem completely
- Read the problem statement and identify input format, output requirements
- Identify all constraints explicitly stated
- Understand what operations/rules are allowed
- Clarify the goal and success criteria

STEP 2: Analyze constraints and implications
- List all numerical constraints (size limits, value ranges)
- Identify which constraints indicate need for efficient solutions
- Note special conditions or edge cases
- Consider how constraints affect algorithm choice

STEP 3: Develop initial approach
- Brainstorm possible solution strategies
- Choose the most straightforward correct approach
- Outline high-level algorithm steps
- Identify needed data structures or helper functions

STEP 4: Verify complexity against constraints
- Calculate time complexity for each operation
- Count worst-case iterations
- Compute total operations for maximum input size
- Verify solution won't timeout (operations should be reasonable for constraints)
- Double-check complexity calculations

STEP 5: Evaluate optimization necessity
- Determine if current approach is efficient enough
- If not, consider: better data structures, caching, precomputation, mathematical patterns
- Decide whether to implement simple version or optimize immediately

STEP 6: Plan implementation specifics
- Break algorithm into concrete coding steps
- Identify edge cases needing special handling
- Plan variables and data structures
- Consider numerical issues (overflow, division, negatives)
- Think through indexing to avoid off-by-one errors

STEP 7: Mental simulation and validation
- Trace through provided examples step-by-step
- Create and test edge cases: empty input, single element, extreme values
- Verify algorithm handles special values correctly
- Check expected outputs match
- Revise if issues found

STEP 8: Implement and review
- Write code following planned structure
- Check loop boundaries and array access
- Verify conditionals use correct operators
- Check for potential runtime errors
- Review line-by-line for bugs

=== SECTION 2: PRE-OUTPUT VERIFICATION (MANDATORY CHECKPOINT) ===

STOP. Before proceeding to output, answer these verification questions:

1. Have you analyzed THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM (not just read generic steps)?
2. Have you developed a CONCRETE SOLUTION for THIS EXACT TASK?
3. Is your reasoning field ready to contain YOUR SPECIFIC ANALYSIS?
4. Is your result field ready to contain YOUR ACTUAL WORKING SOLUTION?

If you answered NO to ANY question above, STOP and complete the actual work.
If you answered YES to ALL questions, proceed to fill the output template.

=== SECTION 3: OUTPUT TEMPLATE (FILL WITH YOUR COMPLETED WORK) ===

Your final output MUST be this JSON structure with BOTH fields filled with your specific work on this task.
Do NOT leave placeholder text. Do NOT output instructions. Do NOT output empty fields.

{
    "reasoning": "",
    "result": ""
}

FILL INSTRUCTIONS:
- "reasoning" field: Insert your complete step-by-step analysis of THIS problem
- "result" field: Insert your complete working solution code for THIS problem

Both fields must contain your actual completed work, not templates or instructions.
