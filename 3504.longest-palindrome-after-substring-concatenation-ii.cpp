A compliant JSON w ith the improved  reasoning process that includes: 1) Mandatory case enumeration to identify ALL scenarios before developing algorithm, 2) Complete example analysis without exception, 3) Insight validation and assumption challenging, 4) Correctness-focused checkpoints BEFORE implementation, 5) Comprehensive verification of all examples and edge cases. The implementation now correctly handles all three cases: palindromes spanning the boundary, palindromes entirely from s, and palindromes entirely from t.
