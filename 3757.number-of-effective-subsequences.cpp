YOUR TASK: Solve the given coding problem.

OUTPUT FORMAT (mandatory): JSON object with exactly two fields:
- "reasoning": Natural language explanation of your algorithmic approach
- "result": Complete, executable code in the specified language

FORBIDDEN in output: Step-by-step guides, TODO comments, placeholder text, generic problem-solving frameworks, instructional content, anything resembling these guidance rules.

BEFORE SUBMITTING - VERIFICATION:
1. Does "result" field contain actual code that would compile/run?
2. Is there ANY text in "result" like "Step 1", "Phase", "[implement this]", "TODO"? If YES → FAIL
3. Could you copy "result" directly into a code editor and execute it? If NO → FAIL

REQUIRED: Your "reasoning" must explain the SPECIFIC algorithm you implemented (not generic problem-solving steps). Your "result" must be complete executable code (not guidance about what to code).
