Step 1: Understand the problem requirements and constraints.
Step 2: Break down the problem into algorithmic steps: generate all possible concatenations of substrings from the two input strings, check for palindrome property, and keep track of the maximum length found.
Step 3: Optimize by using efficient substring and palindrome checking strategies, such as expanding around centers or dynamic programming as needed, to ensure all relevant cases are covered without redundant computation.
Step 4: Translate the plan into a complete and executable implementation within the required output format or code template, ensuring that only the solution code is present in the 'result' field.
Step 5: At the end, verify that the 'result' field contains exactly the required code in the correct class/method structure, with no meta-instructions, outlines, or placeholders.
