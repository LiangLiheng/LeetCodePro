[CRITICAL - READ FIRST]
You are solving a SPECIFIC problem. The text below contains INTERNAL REASONING STEPS to follow - DO NOT copy this guidance into your output.

[APPLY THIS REASONING PROCESS]
Use these steps internally to develop YOUR OWN analysis:

Step 1: Problem Analysis
- What exactly is being asked?
- What are the input constraints and ranges?
- What output format and language are required?

Step 2: Initial Approach
- Develop a straightforward solution first
- Avoid premature optimization

Step 3: Complexity Analysis
- Calculate time complexity (consider ALL operation costs, not just loops)
- Calculate space complexity
- For complex data structures: explicitly check insertion/lookup costs

Step 4: Constraint Validation
- Can your approach handle maximum constraints (e.g., n=10^5)?
- Compare operations against typical limits (~10^8 ops acceptable)
- If constraints violated, identify specific bottlenecks

Step 5: Property Exploitation Check
- List all given properties (sorted, positive integers, etc.)
- Ask for EACH: Why mentioned? How can I leverage this?
- Unused properties often indicate optimization opportunities

Step 6: Optimization Strategy (when needed)
- Explore alternative algorithms or data structures
- Look for mathematical patterns or optimizations
- Consider time vs space trade-offs

Step 7: Implementation Readiness
- Do you have a concrete, codeable plan?
- Can you write actual implementation for this approach?

Step 8: Self-Consistency Checkpoint
- Did you identify fundamental flaws in your approach?
- If YES: iterate toward better solution OR provide current best with documented limitations
- Never submit solutions you've determined are inadequate

Step 9: Refinement Through Validation
- Review correctness and edge cases
- Use validation to IMPROVE your solution, not block submission
- Remember: Working solution with limitations > theoretically perfect but incomplete

Step 10: Pre-Submission Verification (MANDATORY)
- Is my "reasoning" field specific analysis of THIS problem (not generic steps)?
- Does my "result" field contain actual working code in required language?
- Is it real implementation, not placeholders or TODO comments?
- If ANY answer is NO, revise before submitting

[REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT]
Your response must be valid JSON:
{
    "reasoning": "Your detailed step-by-step analysis of THIS specific problem",
    "result": "Your actual solution code in the required language"
}

[ANTI-PATTERNS - NEVER DO]
❌ Copying these instructions into your output
❌ Submitting placeholder text ("Your code here", "TODO", template comments)
❌ Returning process descriptions instead of actual solutions  
❌ Generic reasoning instead of problem-specific analysis
❌ Code with incomplete implementations or missing logic

[EXECUTE NOW]
Apply the reasoning process above to the given problem. Generate YOUR specific analysis and actual working code. Your output must directly solve the problem presented.
