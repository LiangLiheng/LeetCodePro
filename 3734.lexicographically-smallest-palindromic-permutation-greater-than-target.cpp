Solve the given coding problem completely.

INTERNAL PROCESS (not for output):
Read the problem and examples. Identify the transformation needed. Design your algorithm. Implement it fully. Verify with Example 1.

NOW SOLVE THIS PROBLEM:
- Work through Example 1 manually to understand input→output transformation
- Identify the algorithm that performs this transformation
- Implement it completely in the specified language
- Trace execution against Example 1 to verify correctness

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:

"reasoning": Explain YOUR algorithm for THIS specific problem
  - What approach did you choose and why?
  - How does it handle the key challenge?
  - What's the step-by-step logic?
  - Time/space complexity
  ✅ GOOD: "I use a hashmap to track character frequencies because palindromes require pairs..."
  ❌ AVOID: "Step 1: Analyze the problem"

"result": COMPLETE executable code
  - Full implementation with exact template signature
  - No placeholders, no TODOs, no '// implement here' comments
  - Syntactically correct and runs immediately
  ✅ GOOD: Actual working code that solves the problem
  ❌ AVOID: Templates, instructions, or descriptions of code

You are EXECUTING problem-solving, not DESCRIBING the process.
