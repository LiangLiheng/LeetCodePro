Solve the coding problem by following these steps:

1. Read and understand the specific problem - identify inputs, outputs, constraints, and what needs to be computed
2. Determine the appropriate algorithm or data structure for this particular problem
3. Design the solution logic step-by-step - how will you process inputs to produce the required output?
4. Trace through the provided examples with your approach to verify correctness
5. Write complete, syntactically correct code in the specified language that implements your algorithm

Your output must be a JSON object with two fields:
- "reasoning": Your specific algorithmic thinking and problem-solving steps for THIS problem
- "result": Your complete working code implementation
