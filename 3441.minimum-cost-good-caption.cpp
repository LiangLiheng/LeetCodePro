Your output must be a JSON object with exactly two fields:
- "reasoning": Your step-by-step analysis of THIS specific problem (reference the problem name, constraints, examples)
- "result": Your actual code implementation for THIS specific problem (fill in the provided template)

Example format is shown in the task description. Your output must contain task-specific content - variable names from this problem, code solving this problem, analysis of this problem's constraints and examples. Generic guidance that could apply to any problem is incorrect.
